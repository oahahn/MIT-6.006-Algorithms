## MIT 6.006 - Introduction to Algorithms
This is an introductory course covering elementary data structures (dynamic arrays, heaps, balanced binary search trees, hash tables) and algorithmic approaches to solve classical problems (sorting, graph searching, dynamic programming). This course is offered on the MIT OpenCourseWare website, I worked through the material at my own pace.
